We’re building the Garant backend MVP: a Hono API on Cloudflare Workers with D1 + Drizzle that handles
wallet auth (nonce + signature → JWT), ownership verification (ERC‑20/721/1155), access rules
enforcement, and an activity/events feed sourced from contract events.

- learn erc-standards
- what is wallet auth flow?
- implement wallet auth (nonce + signature → JWT)
- implement ownership verification (ERC‑20/721/1155)
- implement access rules enforcement
- implement activity/events feed sourced from contract events
- write tests
